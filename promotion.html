The way we evaluate academics for hiring, promotion and tenure
decisions is far from perfect. But there are ongoing efforts to move
away from journal-based metrics and towards alternative metrics
that recognize open scholarship practices.
</p>

<section>

<header><h3>Using better metrics</h3></header>  

<p>
In 2013, the American Society for Cell Biology, along with
collaborating academics and organizations, released
the <a href="www.ascb.org/dora/">San Francisco Declaration on Research
Assessment</a> (DORA). So, what does DORA say?
</p>

<br/>

<center><embed src="images/DORA_poster_2013.pdf" width="900px"
	       height="1380px"></center>

<br/>

With DORA, the emphasis is put on scientific content rather than
journal label. In addition, explicit value is placed on research
outputs other than articles, like shared data and code. To date, over
12,000 individuals and nearly 600 organizations and institutions have
signed, pledging to uphold these recommendations.

</p>
<blockquote>
VCU Promotion and tenure committees should recognize that publication
and editorial effort in open access, peer-reviewed journals or
re-publication of peer-reviewed articles in an open access repository
offers added value and greater public good than scholarship made only
available in expensive journal publications.

     20px;float:left"></a>
</p>
<blockquote>
The academy should adapt existing frameworks for tenure and promotion,
and merit-based incentives to account for alternative forms of
publication and research output including data papers, public data
sets, and digital products. Value inheres in data as a standalone
research output.

<header><h3>Open scholarship success stories</h3></header>

<p>
In October 2015, academics from the
<a href="http://arcscon.tumblr.com/">Advancing Research Communication
& Scholarship (ARCS)</a> conference and the open access publishing
platform <a href="https://thewinnower.com">The Winnower</a> ran a
competition to showcase and reward open scholarship stories.
The <a href="https://thewinnower.com/keywords/arcs2015">collection</a>
includes 13
essays. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://thewinnower.com/papers/2301-my-open-science-story">Jon
Tennant</a> wrote about his journey into open science, including how
sharing his research has led to opportunities to write for online
media, television interviews, and invitations to international
conferences. <a href="https://thewinnower.com/papers/2313-how-contributing-to-open-source-launched-my-academic-career">Juan
Pablo Alperin</a> described how his contributions to an open source
project launched his career, leading first to a job, then a PhD, and
now defining his research
program. <a href="https://thewinnower.com/papers/2368-you-don-t-get-to-2000-open-data-sets-without-making-a-few-friends-or-how-i-got-to-be-called-the-mark-zuckerberg-of-open-source-genetics">Bastian
Greshake</a> recounted how he became the Mark Zuckerburg of open
source genetics, as an open project he launched led to awards,
funding, publications, speaking invitations, and more. Check out the
many other stories of success.
</p>

<p>
Also, hear C. Titus Brown talk about how to get tenure as an open
scientist in this webcast from OpenCon.
